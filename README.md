Run the redis server (redis stack with both server and the ui management) before running the node server. Cool 

-Redis for caching and can also be used as pub/sub to pass realtime data to other servers in a scaled system like multiple socket servers 
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest

# Redis with Docker and Node.js

## Run Redis Server using Docker
Run the Redis Stack server with both the Redis server and UI management interface by executing the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

This command will:
- Pull and run the latest Redis stack image.
- Map port 6379 for the Redis server and port 8001 for the Redis UI.
- Detach the container, running it in the background.
